# Notes

This is the notes of HackEd Project 7

## Ideas for our project

The ideas for how we want our project to turn out.

### What comes to mind when you think of games?  

Interactive, fun, engaging.

### What game are we thinking of making?

We wittled it down to either Snake, or a dodging game, utilising the accelerometer for the latter so that we can make it more interactive and a more engaging experience
